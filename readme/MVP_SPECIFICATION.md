organizations
users
subspecialties
shift_types
shift_instances
vacation_preferences
assignments
fairness_ledger
swaps
audit_logs
```

### Key Business Rules (MVP)
1. **Vacation:** 1 week per month, 3 ranked choices, fairness-based resolution
2. **FTE Mapping:** 60-69%=8 PT days, 70-79%=6 PT days, etc.
3. **Eligibility:** Subspecialty-based, allow-any, or named restrictions
4. **Fairness:** Scoring system for vacation tie-breaking and workload distribution
5. **Swaps:** Same shift type only, sequential offers, approval required

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complex scheduling logic:** Start with heuristic algorithm, plan for constraint solver
- **Performance with large datasets:** Implement pagination and caching early
- **Multi-tenant complexity:** Design data isolation from day one

### Business Risks
- **Changing requirements:** Use configuration-driven approach
- **User adoption:** Focus on intuitive UX and gradual rollout
- **Data migration:** Plan import/export tools early

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, PostgreSQL 14+, Git
2. **Setup:** Clone repo, install dependencies, setup database
3. **Development:** Run local dev server, setup test data
4. **Deployment:** Vercel/Railway for hosting, Supabase for database

This MVP specification provides a solid foundation for the radiology scheduling platform while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and customization.
