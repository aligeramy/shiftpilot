- **Q:** Walk me through your current vacation scheduling process from start to finish. How long does it typically take?
- **Q:** What tools/systems are you currently using? (Excel, email, calendar software, etc.)
- **Q:** How far in advance do you collect vacation preferences? (e.g., November/December for next year?)
- **Q:** What's your biggest time sink in the current process?
- **Q:** How many hours per month do you spend on vacation scheduling vs. daily shift assignments?

### 1.2 Pain Points
- **Q:** What are the top 3 most frustrating parts of the current process?
- **Q:** Where do most conflicts arise? (overlapping requests, last-minute changes, coverage gaps?)
- **Q:** How do you currently handle vacation conflicts? Email threads, phone calls, meetings?
- **Q:** Have you ever had to completely redo a vacation schedule? What triggered that?
- **Q:** What keeps you up at night about scheduling?

### 1.3 Communication Challenges
- **Q:** How do radiologists currently submit vacation requests? (email, form, verbal?)
- **Q:** How many back-and-forth rounds typically happen before finalizing vacation schedules?
- **Q:** Do radiologists ever "game" the system? (e.g., coordinating requests, strategic timing?)
- **Q:** How do you communicate decisions? (individual emails, group email, meeting?)

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Vacation Scheduling Rules (Validation & Clarification)

### 2.1 Subspecialty Coverage Caps
Based on your email, we have:
- **Body MRI:** Max 2 on vacation per week
- **Cardiac:** Max 2 on vacation per week  
- **IR:** Max 1 on vacation per week

**Questions:**
- **Q:** Are these hard limits or guidelines? Have you ever needed to violate them?
- **Q:** Are there other subspecialty coverage requirements we should know about?
- **Q:** Do these caps change seasonally? (e.g., summer vs. winter?)
- **Q:** What happens if multiple people in the same subspecialty request the same week?

### 2.2 Mammography Coverage
You mentioned:
- Minimum 1 mammo Bx rad (absolute)
- Ideally 2+ mammo Bx rads
- Aim for 5 total mammo-qualified rads available
- Special: NS case (if only mammo rad, need DL or DW on Tuesdays)

**Questions:**
- **Q:** Has there ever been a week where you couldn't meet the minimum 1 mammo rad requirement?
- **Q:** The NS special case (DL/DW on Tuesdays for cardiac) - how often does this constraint bind?
- **Q:** Are there specific days of the week where mammo coverage is more critical? (e.g., biopsy clinic days?)
- **Q:** You mentioned Kathy Zhao does biopsies 2x/month ad-hoc. Should the system flag weeks she's scheduled to remind you?
- **Q:** Are there other radiologists who might become mammo-qualified soon?

### 2.3 Part-Time (PT) Status
**Q:** You mentioned being "cognizant of PT status" for neuro/body coverage. Can you give me an example of when this became an issue?  
**Q:** Do PT radiologists get vacation priority since they work fewer days?  
**Q:** Should the system calculate "effective FTE" when checking coverage? (e.g., 2 PT rads = 1.2 FTE instead of 2.0?)  
**Q:** Do PT percentages change throughout the year? How often?

### 2.4 Consecutive Vacation Limits
**Q:** What's the maximum consecutive weeks someone can request?  
**Q:** You mentioned "limit on long consecutive runs" - is there a hard cap? (e.g., no more than 2 consecutive weeks?)  
**Q:** If someone requests 2 weeks in a row, does that count as their P1 and P2 choices?  
**Q:** Do you allow split weeks? (e.g., Wed-Sun vacation?)

### 2.5 Total Vacation Capacity
**Q:** What's the maximum percentage of radiologists that can be on vacation in any given week?  
**Q:** We calculated 30% (8 out of 27 rads) - does that sound right?  
**Q:** Does this vary by time of year? (e.g., higher capacity in summer?)  
**Q:** Have you ever had a week where "too many" people were off, even if subspecialty rules were met?

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Preference Collection & Fairness

### 3.1 Preference Submission
**Q:** Do radiologists typically submit all 3 choices (P1, P2, P3) for every month?  
**Q:** What percentage of people submit requests late or not at all?  
**Q:** How do you handle late submissions? Are they penalized?  
**Q:** You mentioned Saba ranked chronologically instead of by priority. How common is this misunderstanding?

### 3.2 Flexibility & Intent
**Q:** When someone marks a request as "flexible," what does that mean to you?  
**Q:** How often do you have to infer what someone "really wanted" vs. what they submitted?  
**Q:** Are there radiologists who consistently submit ambiguous requests?  
**Q:** Would it help to have a free-text "notes" field for requests? (e.g., "Need this for family wedding")

### 3.3 Fairness Tracking
**Q:** How do you currently track fairness across the year?  
**Q:** Do you keep a mental tally of who got P1 choices vs. who didn't?  
**Q:** Have radiologists ever complained about fairness? What was the issue?  
**Q:** If someone doesn't get their P1 choice, do they get "first dibs" next month?  
**Q:** How do you balance fairness vs. clinical coverage needs?

### 3.4 Special Cases
**Q:** Are there radiologists who get vacation priority? (e.g., parents with school-age kids during summer, senior staff?)  
**Q:** Do fellows/residents have different vacation rules than full radiologists?  
**Q:** Are there "blackout periods" where certain people can't take vacation? (e.g., academic year, major conferences?)

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Shift Assignment (Beyond Vacation)

### 4.1 Daily Schedule Generation
**Q:** Once vacation is locked in, how long does it take to generate the daily shift assignments?  
**Q:** What rules apply to daily assignments that we haven't discussed?  
**Q:** Are there "desirable" and "undesirable" shifts? How should we weight them?  
**Q:** Weekend call seems to be the most undesirable - are there others?

### 4.2 Named Shifts
You mentioned:
- **MA1:** 6 specific radiologists
- **Coiling:** Ramiro only

**Q:** Are there other named/restricted shifts we should know about?  
**Q:** For MA1, all 6 are equally qualified, or are some preferred?  
**Q:** What happens if Ramiro is on vacation during a coiling day (Tue/Wed)? Does the shift get cancelled or covered differently?  
**Q:** Are there radiologists training to become eligible for named shifts?

### 4.3 Shift Desirability
**Q:** Can you rank all 23 shift types from most desirable to least desirable?  
**Q:** Which shifts are considered "prime clinic slots" that people want?  
**Q:** Are late blocks (16-18, 18-21) equally undesirable, or is 18-21 worse?  
**Q:** Do radiologists have individual preferences? (e.g., some prefer evenings?)

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Conflict Resolution & Decision Making

### 5.1 Current Decision Process
**Q:** When multiple people want the same vacation week, what's your decision-making process?  
**Q:** Do you ever split the difference? (e.g., give both people 3 days each?)

**Q:** Have you ever had to make a decision that upset someone? How did you handle it?

### 5.2 Override & Exceptions
**Q:** What percentage of the schedule do you manually override after the initial plan?  
**Q:** What are the most common reasons for manual overrides?  
**Q:** Are there "sacred" shifts that can't be touched? (e.g., someone always works Mondays?)  
**Q:** How do you document exception decisions so you remember them next time?

### 5.3 AI Decision Preferences
**Q:** For "flexible" requests, would you like the AI to:
  - A) Auto-assign to the optimal week (you review after)
  - B) Present you with 2-3 options and let you choose
  - C) Flag for manual review every time

**Q:** When AI infers priority (like Saba's summer preference), what confidence level should trigger your review? (90%? 70%?)  
**Q:** If AI makes a decision you disagree with, would you want to:
  - A) Override it and teach the AI
  - B) Just override it
  - C) Revert and manually handle
