We are starting to organize vacation for 2026 which will be done in 3 separate rounds, similar to previous years.

For the first round (priority 1, aka "P1" vacation), we will require requests for your top 5 weeks of vacation, ranked in order of preference.

Please submit these P1 requests to me 
(chantelhgh@whxray.com) by Monday September 8th at noon.


With thanks,
Chantel

 
Reminders:

-Full weeks only for the first round please.

-Flexibility is encouraged and greatly appreciated!

-You can select a maximum of 3 weeks in the summer (June 29 - Sept 4) and a maximum of 1 week at March Break (weeks of March 9 and March 16). Along with RSNA (week of Nov 30), these must be made as priority 1 and 2 requests (as space is limited, ranking as P1 is highly recommended).

-Please try to avoid March Break requests if you are without school-age children or without a significant other in the teaching profession. If you are not planning to attend RSNA, please avoid requesting RSNA week.

-No requests for the weeks of Jan 5 (used Christmas 2025/New Year's scheduling) as well as Dec 14, Dec 21, and Dec 28, 2026 (used for catch up and Christmas 2026/New Year's scheduling)

-The rules for the first round are otherwise non-constraining. You can be as specific as requesting the 3rd week of July or as flexible as stating you want any 3 available weeks in the summer. You can also request pairing weeks together if you are planning a longer trip/holiday - this can also be specific or flexible. As always, if it is possible to offer flexibility with your requests it is much appreciated as it allows for more opportunities for vacation requests to be accommodated for you and all other members of the group.

-The most recent scheduling rules and guidelines, as approved at our Dec 2017 pre-association meeting, are available on our shared Google drive via this link (note: we have since moved to 12 weeks of vacation for association members taking call; 10 weeks 1st year staff; grandfather clause for CC and DK 11 weeks respectively; full week for Xmas/NY; DW as WH CEO; Steph G for Lori Power):

-If you are interested in exploring the snowbird option (winter sabbatical without financial compensation from January up to the start of March Break), please let us know. Note that we likely will not be able to accommodate the snowbird option in 2026 given staffing requirements.
